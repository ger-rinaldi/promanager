# The magic is in the entry_points parameter.
# Below console_scripts, each line identifies one console script.
# The first part before the equals sign (=) is the name of the script
# that should be generated, the second part is the import
# path followed by a colon (:) with the Click command.

# Thatâ€™s it.
